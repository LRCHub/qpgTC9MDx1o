I said look, how can I live?
With so much anger barbecuing in my ribs? Within
Past shake, came back shake
Cleaned up my closet, came back to a grave
Guess I'm workin' this shift, for landin' in the car
Aha, went jumpless, stiff, I'm the wi-izz
What you think? That I don't fuck you to witness?
Why do I go so slow?
Huh, till the beat don't beat
Then it was Too Short, like Jesus please
I do anything for a kiss and a hug
And I give up my advice to hear you speak again

Come back baby, don't you cry!
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawlin'

What ya thank? I can see you cry a river
Eye down this crowded rental, I'm a soul you cannot remember
Get myself a hoe you cannot get into
Now went down and in it when I released some tension
Smackin' and grabbin' the grave stones of our memories
Havin' the lame ones get the penguins, I'm laughin'
The same ones, they ain't shit to me, that's it
Flash dicks with the ass kicks
It's a habit never lasting
I said that's it, never mind, chick
I said pass it, told you, that's it!
I said flash, bitch, sniff an ass-kick
I said habit never lasting
I said that's it, never mind, chick
I said pass it, told you
That's it, that's it, that's it!

Come back baby, don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I keep calling you
